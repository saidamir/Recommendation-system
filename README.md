Recommendation Engine for IBM Watson
This project is a part of Udacity and IBM Watson collaboration

In this project I am creating a recommendation system for the IBM Watson community. The recommendation system suggests articles for users to read.

The recommender system can make recommendations in a number of ways:

Collaborative Filtering - uses similarity of users and recommends the most popular articles read by similar users

Rank Based Recommendations - recommends the highest ranked articles starting with the most highly ranked

Content Based Filtering - produces recommendations based on similarity of articles' titles to one another. Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodology to analyse and rank articles by similarity.
SVD - Matrix Factorization Recommendations - uses matrix operations to predict the ranking
